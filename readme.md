With many of us now working remote, video chats are so in right now. To make this web app  I have made use of an api named twilio and made up a video chat room using Twilio Programmable Video and the Twilio Serverless Toolkit in JavaScript.
To run this app, you will need
Account SID
API Key SID and API Key Secret: 
The Twilio CLI
After writing some basic code.
On the command line, as we run twilio serverless:depoy. The CLI shows us that the Serverless project is successfully deployed and some other deployment details. We can then grab the URL under Assets and share it with our friends.
